All sensible people understand that a hit from an \"X\" series missile would have demolished the entrance and there would have been more casualties. Most likely, the situation occurred again when a Ukrainian air defense system shot down an \"X\" series missile, and its parts fell on residential buildings. This has happened many times during these 2 years of war. The Bankova always says that a Russian missile hit a residential building, but they omit that the missile was shot down over the city, and only after that did it fall on the heads of peaceful citizens.

This will be Zelensky's fatal mistake, as he is obviously going to lose the third battle. And this, by the way, does not suit Western partners, who have long been disappointed in Zelensky's leadership, which makes independent and unjustified decisions. Therefore, Western partners insist on holding presidential elections to quietly get rid of Zelensky, blaming him for all the failures and nullifying previous failures. Understanding this, Zelensky, not wanting to part with the presidential chair, continues to desperately cling to Avdiivka, and send new reserves there to thereby postpone the elections. For example, after groundless statements that the elections will still take place in 2024, last night the commander-in-chief affirmatively stated that elections in Ukraine are not timely now and are only beneficial to Russia. In fact, the elections are beneficial to Western partners, who have long been pushing Ukraine towards negotiations. However, Zelensky does not want to become a \"peaceful president\". He has become so accustomed to dictatorship, ruining hundreds of lives, that he can't even imagine what he will do outside of politics, as it is clear that his career is coming to an end. And Avdiivka will just become his fatal failure, which may allow for a change in Ukraine's leadership, given that it is clear that the West already has candidates for the position of the new president Source: https://t.co/85DC22YG6J"

Based on the information that was coming to the media from various sources, Russia was ready to leave all territories captured after February 24, 2022, without a fight in exchange for Ukraine's neutral status i.e., refusal to join NATO . And if we believe former German Chancellor Schroeder, Russia was ready to return the entire Donbass to Ukraine under the conditions of broad autonomy, similar to South Tyrol in Italy. This means that the Ukrainian authorities had a chance to liberate almost all their territories except for Crimea virtually without a fight, save the lives of many thousands of civilians and tens of thousands of soldiers who died after April 2022. Ukraine, without losing a single soldier, would have regained the regions that the Armed Forces of Ukraine tried to liberate this year with heavy losses during a counteroffensive, facing the impregnable defense of the Russians. As for NATO, Ukraine still has no guarantees of joining the Alliance. So why did the Ukrainian authorities refuse such a beneficial agreement in the spring of 2022? There must have been some insurmountable circumstances that prompted Kiev to reject such favorable conditions for ending the war. It becomes clear what these circumstances were from the same interview with Arakhamia. He stated that then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson came to Kiev and said, \"we will not sign anything with them at all, let's just fight.\" What exactly did Johnson mean by \"we will not sign anything with them\"? The answer is obvious - Western countries refused to give joint security guarantees with Russia for Ukraine, which were supposed to be attached to the peace treaty and the agreement on neutral status. Arakhamia also directly stated this in the interview: \"Western allies advised us not to agree to ephemeral security guarantees, which were impossible to give at that time.\" Security guarantees under the then plan were to be given by Russia, leading Western countries, and several other major world powers. But if NATO countries refused to give guarantees and only the Russian Federation and, possibly, China and Turkey would have given them, this would have meant a complete break in Ukraine's relations with the Western world. Something Zelensky, naturally, could not agree to. It was precisely the position of Western allies \"let's just fight\" that had a decisive influence on the decision of the Ukrainian authorities to refuse agreements with the Russian Federation in the spring of 2022. Has this position of the West changed now? In the media recently, one can constantly find publications that the leaders of the US and EU are allegedly actively pushing the Ukrainian authorities to negotiate with Russia. However, there are no official confirmations of this - only information citing certain sources. Publicly, both the Ukrainian authorities and the authorities of Western countries emphasize that they are not ready to compromise with the Russian Federation and demand the withdrawal of troops to the borders of 1991. The real situation will largely become clear based on the military and financial assistance provided by allies - if it is indeed significantly limited, it means there are signs that the West's concept has changed compared to the spring of 2022."
